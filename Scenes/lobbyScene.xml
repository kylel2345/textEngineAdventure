        -->
        As you enter the Helco-Saeb Hotel, you can't help but to notice the yellowing on the white papered walls, and the spider webs in the corners.  Perhaps once a welcoming lobby, now it inspires slight psychological discomfort at the best of times.  Poorly lit, worn carpet, and a general sense of despair greet you with a wry smile.
